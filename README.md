## Project Design Brainstorm

> I'm planning to go for all the points and have elements of 3 design patterns working together!
 
> -> STRUCTURAL DESIGN: Decorator pattern for PCs (classes and races and backgrounds with their respective bonuses)
>
> -> BUILDER DESIGN: Factory pattern for generating monsters, rooms, loot tables (for chests and shop inventory)
>
> -> BEHAVIORAL DESIGN: Observer pattern for triggering random encounters (wandering monster, weird dungeon events, etc)
